1. This is a maven base project, so you can import it into any IDE that you like. I'm using STS, a eclipse base IDE so I imported by choosing "Imports from existing Maven project"
2. Please browse to src/main/java then find the main class with name "App" which lives in package "com.episerver.booklibrary", right click and choose "Run as Java Application"
   This is the easiest way for you to start the app
3. After the app has been launched you can see some options (from 1 - 8), please enter the number which associated with the option that you want to choose and see the result
   You can also browse to "src/test/java" to run the unit tests. There are 2 unit tests files: FacadeTest.java and FacadeMockTest.java, right click on your IDE and choose "Run with JUnit Tests"
